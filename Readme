Jan. 2023

=====
Overview:
    There are two groups in this kit

-----
    Data generation program:
    matrixgen.c      source file for the input data generation program

-----
    Important functions:
    timer.h          macro definition for time measurement
    lab1_IO.h        header for the lab1_IO.c, need to be included to call the IOs directly from lab1_IO.c
    lab1_IO.c        source file for the IO functions, need to be referred in the compiler line if the functions are called in the program

Files

-----
    Makefile
        make all: compile matrixgen.c, main.c and test.c to          executables
        make clean: remove all .o files, all executable and data_input, data_output files
        make clean1: remove only data_input and data_output files, might be useful for debugging

-----
    main.c: 
        Main program to perform the parallel matrix multiplication.
        Execute as: ./main

-----
    test.c:
        A test program that generate test cases to verify main.c
